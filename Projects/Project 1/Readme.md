N - Puzzle Solver.

Project to Solve N-Puzzle using uniform cost search, A* with misplaced tile heuristic, A* with manhattan distance heuristic.
Completed For CS-205: Artificial Intelligence at UCR.

- The code is menu driven and can be run directly without changes.
- The code is extensible and can be run for any input and any goal state
- The code has error handling and checks for user inputs.
- To add any other heuristic function, update the node class and add new heuristic function to calculate cost.

- The project by default runs for 8 puzzle. No additional change is required for higher order puzzle, just input the goal and test puzzle.
- The project does not use inversion count to check if the puzzle is solvable or not.
- The Project contains some default puzzles, 1 for each depth starting from 0 - 30.
- More can be generated by using the function `create_puzzle_book`, which is commented by default

- The project plots graphs for time, total nodes expanded and max frontier queue size. 
- The code `run_analysis` is commented by default.

- In case you do not wish to run the UI and take in user input and directly run the analysis, comment out the `main_block`.

- The main search code is present in `general_search` function.

- The code uses `Node` class that is defined in this code itself.
